NAME
    cp2foss - upload one or more files or archives into FOSSology and run
    scans.

SYNOPSIS
     Usage: cp2foss [options] [archives]
     Options: -AQThv [-f path] [-AA num] [-q {agent,agent.. | all}] [-X path]
     [-n name] [-d description] [--username user name] [--password password]
     [-c configuration directory] [-s Run synchronously]
     [-P set public permission]
     [-S upload from subversion repo] [-G upload from git repo] [--user user name for vcs] [--pass password for vcs]

DESCRIPTION
    cp2foss (copy to FOSSology) will load one or more files or archives into
    the folder path specified by -f. The folders in the *folder-path* do not
    need to exist. cp2foss will create them as needed.

    Archives can be a file, directory or URL to the archive. If the archive
    is a URL, then it is retrieved and added. If the archive is a file, then
    it is used as the source to add. If the archive is a directory, then
    *all* files under it are recursively added.

    The archive support globbing - '*', all the matched files will be added.
    Note: have to put it in single/double quotes, e.g. '*.php'

    A single hyphen means the archive list will come from standard in
    (stdin).

  Options
    NOTE: The order of the options is significant. Options are processed in
    the order that they are used on the command line.

    -A  Turn on *alpha-folders*. Default is off. When many archives are
        loaded, navigating through all the folders can be difficult. This
        option groups packages under alpha folders based on the first letter
        of the package name. For example, your folder path is
        *ProjX/pass1/*. Using alpha-folders the archive "andyroid" would end
        up under a folder path *ProjX/pass/a-c/andyroid*.

    -AA num
        Specify the number of letters per folder (default: 3); implies -A.
        For example, using the default, the alpha folders would be a-c, d-f,
        g-i and so on.

    -d *description*
        A short meaningful description the captures what the upload folder
        will contain. Description must be quoted with either single or
        double quotes. This is ignored if you are uploading a directory.

    -f *path*
        folder path for storing uploaded files (e.g., -f 'Fedora/ISOs/Disk
        1'). You do not need to specify your top level folder. All paths are
        under the user top level folder. cp2foss will correctly create all
        of the other intermediate folders in the path under the top folder.

    -?  Help, see -h

    -h  Help, prints a verbose usage message.

    --username *username*
        username, specify the username for a user who has the priviledge to
        execute cp2foss. Alternatively, you can add the file .fossology.rc
        in your current home directory, add user name and password in 2
        separate lines.

    --password *password*
        password, specify the password for a user who has the priviledge to
        execute cp2foss. Alternatively, you can add the file .fossology.rc
        in your current home directory, add user name and password in 2
        separate lines.

    -c *configuration directory*
        Specify the directory for the system configuration, when
        installation from src, default dir is /usr/local/etc/fossology/,
        when installation from package, default dir is /etc/fossology/. This
        defaults to your last installation location.

    -P *set public permission*
        set the permission to public on this upload or not. 1: yes; 0: no

    -s *Run synchronously*
        Run synchronously. Don't return until archive already in FOSSology
        repository. If the archive is a file (see below), then the file can
        be safely removed.

    -n *name*
        An optional name that will be used to store the upload in the
        database. The default name is the filename from the upload. Must be
        set before each archive. Ignored if you specify a directory to
        upload.

    -Q  List all available processing agents. Any or all of the agents
        listed can be used with the -q option. See -q for more details.

    -q *agent-list | all*
        Indicate what processing agents to use in analyzing the upload. The
        list is specified as a comma-separated list of agents, (use -Q to
        display the list of agents), or the word *all*. If -q is not used,
        the item will still be uploaded and unpacked. To schedule agent jobs
        later see fossjobs or use the FOSSology web interface.

    -T  TEST. (for Debugging) No database or repository updates are
        performed. Test mode enables verbose mode. This is a trial run of
        the actions that cp2foss will do.

    -v  Verbose (for debugging). Details the actions being performed. -T
        turns this on automatically.

    -X  Items to exclude when the input archive is a directory. You can
        specify more than one -X. For example, to exclude all svn and cvs
        directories, include the following before the archive's directory
        path: -X .svn -X .cvs

  Deprecated Options
    -a *archive*
        See Description above.

    -p *path*
        see -f

    -R  Ignored.

    -w  Ignored.

    -W  Ignored.

EXAMPLES
    "cp2foss --username USER --password PASSWORD -f Folder -d 'the first
    file' /tmp/file "

    Would load the archive *file* in the folder *Folder* using the supplied
    descriptions for the upload.

    "cp2foss --username USER --password PASSWORD -q all -p Ubuntu -n 'Gutsy
    Gibon' -d 'Ubuntu Gutsy 7.10'
    'http://ubuntu.cs.utah.edu/releases/gutsy/ubuntu-7.10-desktop-i386.iso'
    "

    The above example, cp2foss will first get the archive using wget. It
    will then load the downloaded archive into the database calling the
    upload 'Gutsy Gibon'.

    "cp2foss --username USER --password PASSWORD -A -f Fedora/Fedora8 -n
    Fedora8 -d 'Fedora 8 Sources' -X .svn -X .cvs /bigdisk/fedora"

    Loads every file under the /bigdisk/fedora directory, except files in
    the Subversion and CVS directories. The files are placed in the UI under
    the folder "Fedora/Fedora8" and are grouped by the first letter of each
    file (a-c, d-f, g-h, etc.).

    "cp2foss --username USER --password PASSWORD -d 'globbing test'
    '/tmp/*.php' "

    The above example, will upload all the php files in /tmp.

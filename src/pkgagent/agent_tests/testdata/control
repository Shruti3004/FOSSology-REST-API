Description: architecture for analyzing software, web interface
 The FOSSology project is a web based framework that allows you to
 upload software to be picked apart and then analyzed by software agents
 which produce results that are then browsable via the web interface.
 Existing agents include license analysis, metadata extraction, and MIME
 type identification.

 This package depends on the packages for the web interface.
